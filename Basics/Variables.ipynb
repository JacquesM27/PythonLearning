    "Python can accept many data types, including:\n",
    "- integers (int).\n",
    "- Floating-point numbers (float).\n",
    "- Writes (str).\n",
    "- Lists (list).\n",
    "- Dictionaries (dict).\n",
    "- Tuples (tuple).\n",
    "- Sets (set).\n",
    "- Booleans (bool).\n",

    "### Numbers in Python\n",
    "- Numbers in Python are of two types:\n",
    "    - Integer numbers (int).\n",
    "    - Floating point numbers (float).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arithmetic in Python\n",
    "### / * + - <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python will follow the order of operations.\n",
    "- We use the double asterisk __*__ for powers (primes are only fractional powers).\n",
    "- Divide always returns a floating-point number.\n",
    "- There are several special operations:\n",
    "    - Modulo (x%y) gives the remainder of dividing x by y.\n",
    "    - Divide (x//y) gives the result of dividing x by y rounded down to the nearest whole number.\n"
